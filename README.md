# AI-POWERED PHISHING EMAIL DETECTOR

Detect phishing emails using the power of AI, NLP, and LLMs.

This tool goes beyond traditional rule-based filters by using intelligent content analysis to flag suspicious emails and provide actionable security recommendations.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

Phishing is one of the most common cyber attack methods, tricking users into revealing sensitive information.

This solution leverages AI, Natural Language Processing, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect:
	
 •	Deceptive language pattern
	
 •	Suspicious URLs and domains
	
 •	Social engineering tactics
	
 •	Known phishing templates (via RAG)

This makes it a smarter, adaptive, and explainable phishing detection system.

## KEY FEATURES
	
 •	LLM-Powered Analysis: Detects manipulative tone, urgency, and fraudulent language
	
 •	Function Calling and Entity Extraction: Extracts and validates sender, subject, links, attachments
	
 •	RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Compares emails with a phishing template database

 •	Structured JSON Verdicts: Clear output with danger score, reasons, and recommended action

 •	Prompt Engineering: Tuned prompts for reliable phishing detection

 •	Domain and Link Reputation Checking: Uses VirusTotal, PhishTank, and Google Safe Browsing APIs

 •	Attachment Risk Detection: Flags dangerous file types (exe, scr, js, docm, etc.)

 •	Explainable Results: Provides human-understandable reasons for each decision

 •	Integration Ready: Can be used in email gateways, SOC tools, SIEM systems, or browser extensions

## EXAMPLE JSON OUTPUT

	{
	“verdict”: “phishing”,
	“danger_score”: 92,
	“reasons”: [
	“Unusual sender domain: ‘support-paypal-login.com’”,
	“Urgent language: ‘Your account will be suspended within 24 hours’”,
	“Suspicious shortened URL: ‘bit.ly/4PhishPayPal’”,
	“Email requests personal credentials”,
	“Attachment: ‘invoice.exe’ flagged as malicious”
	],
	“suggestion”: “Do not click links, download attachments, or reply. Report immediately to your security team.”
	}
